1. for checking password, username and email we have install
    express validator => npm install express-validator

2. Path in the form for action filed will this:
    action="/user/register" (/user is important as we are creating separate routes for each)

3. We will not write the URL direct in the database file, for this we will create a .env file
    a. To use env, we have to install 'dotenv' package in our project
    b. Then in index.js file we have require that env package and also need to call that
    c. We have to add that .env in .gitignore file, because we don't upload env file on github.
